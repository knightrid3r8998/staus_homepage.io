                  In March 2019, a company called Staus was born out of nowhere.
                  After many twists and turns, i quit the company i has worked
                  for 20 years as if it was a lie and started a new business
                  with some employees who had worked at the previous company
                  until the end. The company that started out in a small office
                  that day has already passed five years and is entering its
                  sixth year.
                  <br /><br />
                  In the beginning, it was very difficult to start a business
                  without a production plant. It started out difficult, but I
                  was able to adapt it here and there. The funds raised are
                  almost depleted after a year, and the licensing issue has not
                  been resolved for the factory that was obtained with great
                  difficulty. The hard work and mental suffering every day was
                  beyond words. In such a situation, the unexpected disease
                  called Corona came and I felt anxious and nervous every day.
                  Then, by chance, I thought that there would be a demand if the
                  Corona negative pressure ward was manufactured as a module
                  using ship cabin technology, so I researched and created data
                  with my employees. <br /><br />
                  So, while doing business with hope, respected lawyer Won
                  Bong-hee realized that the Singapore. government urgently
                  needed a negative pressure isolation ward. He provided
                  information and introduction, and immediately created
                  materials, gave a presentation via video conference, and held
                  a technical meeting at SINGAPORE GENERAL HOSPITAL. It was done
                  with the officials. I vividly remember creating materials with
                  the design staff late every night. I prepared well and
                  received approval within a week after the technical meeting.
                  The contract meeting was held for two days with the Port
                  Authority of Singapore, and a contract was concluded to
                  complete production and supply of 50 wards within three weeks.
                  For three weeks, production and office staff worked hard to
                  meet the deadline from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. without a single day
                  off, and after exactly three weeks, 50 wards were delivered.
                  After completing the production, the Singapore Port Authority
                  sent the container to the factory for delivery. When I think
                  about that time, I am so grateful to the employees who worked
                  hard in such a difficult environment, and I will never forget
                  the times we had loading and shipping containers. <br />
                  <br />The Singapore National Hospital project became a turning
                  point, and additional requests were made to the National
                  Medical Center and Seoul National University Disaster
                  Hospital, and the modular negative pressure ward was built for
                  two years. I had a busy time. In addition, the PCR laboratory
                  developed together with Macrogen has achieved great results
                  once again, allowing us to build up technology for negative
                  pressure modules. there was. Meanwhile, it was covered in
                  various media outlets, and construction companies proposed.
                  collaboration, making it possible to carry out several modular
                  construction projects. And after many days of research with
                  employees to develop our own products by further supplementing
                  those technologies, a caravan called "PURA VIDA" was born.
                  After that, I went through various financial difficulties and
                  difficulty collecting money, and there was not a single day
                  when I felt at ease, and I felt like I was tense every day.
                  <br /><br />
                  These are still not easy times for the employees who have
                  always overcome such times together, but I dare to promise to
                  repay them better by creating a better future in the future.
                  Of course, I would like to express my infinite gratitude to my
                  family and the families of our employees for their patience
                  and patience during that time. Currently, the company has
                  secured several overseas clients, including shipbuilding and
                  marine companies, and has achieved sales of 10 billion won in
                  just 4 years of establishment. Every year, we are experiencing
                  difficulties in manufacturing due to increases in material and
                  labor costs. To overcome these difficulties, we started
                  preparing for collaboration with Chinese factories two years
                  ago and are now in the process of overcoming production
                  limitations by creating a good cooperative relationship. If
                  anyone were to question Staus's future, it would seem that he
                  couldn't be sure yet. But all employees are working together
                  to think good thoughts and act quickly. The anticipation is
                  greater than the anxiety. If we work hard with the hope that
                  we can do many better things, we will truly be able to create
                  the company of our dreams. As a first-time manager, I'm going
                  through a lot of mistakes and trial and error, but I feel like
                  I can do better now. Because I believe in me and I believe in
                  the future. Because the employees work together... Our
                  employees tell me that Staus is our last mission. If everyone
                  who is here now thinks of it as the last mission and really
                  does their best to achieve good results, wouldn't we be living
                  a good life? So today too, Staus wants to work hard and have
                  fun taking one step at a time and prepare well for the future.
                  <br /><br />ah! Why is the company called Staus? <br /><br />
                  I made up a name for my employees and told them Staus... Star
                  House... Let's create a house where you can see the stars!
                  It's so busy, but you can see the stars sometimes A life of
                  leisure... Let's all stay together in Staus...
